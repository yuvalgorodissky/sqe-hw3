## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called [TODO software name](https://address-of-the-project.com).

[TODO Add some description about the software]

## Installation

[TODO Add a description of the test scenarios you chose to test.
For example, in the case of the Moodle example you saw in the lecture, you can write something like this:
1. We tested the story of an admin who create a new course, adds a teacher and a student to it.
2. We tested how a teacher adds a new quiz to the course with two yes/no questions.

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a BDD testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
You should add a report of your testing to the FinalReport folder. See [Report README](Report/README.md) for more details on the report format.
